---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of these Python routines is to 

	(1) generate stellar luminosity functions (star magnitudes and abundances)
	based on a number of user inputs to model, at the very least, the RGB and
	AGB populations of a given target

and

	(2) generate ADDSTAR (*.add) files to be fed into the DAOPHOT ADDSTAR routine,
	for the purpose of assessing the ability of DAOPHOT to recover stars of known
	position and brightness.


The parameter file "input_params" provides customizability. These parameters include: 

	-N_artstar:	The number of artificial stars per image/iteration. It is generally
			desirable to have enough artificial stars per iteration such that
			the number of iterations is decreased thereby saving computation 
			time. Conversely, too great a number of artificial stars will
			introduce stellar crowding effects that are not present in the
			original imaging. 

			Recommended: 2000 stars

	-TRGB_mag:	The instrumental mag of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. This value is
			equivalent to a would-be variable called "RGB_min".

	-RGB_max:	The extent of RGB below input TRGB mag

			Recommended: TRGB_mag + 1 magnitude

	-AGB_min:	Extent of AGB above the TRGB mag. Conversely, the would-be variable AGB_max 
			is always set to be RGB_max, i.e. the same depth in the luminosity function.

	-RGB_slope:	The slope of the RGB luminosity function in dex

			Recommended: 0.3

	-AGB_slope:	Slope of the AGB luminosity function in dex

			Recommended: 0.1 to 0.5

	-X_image_dim:	Size of the science image's X-dimension in pixels. This variable is
			used to generate random locations for artificial stars to lie.
	
			Recommended: 4096 pixels for ACS/WFC

	-Y_image_dim:	Size of the science image's Y-dimension in pixels.
		
			Recommended: 2048 pixels for ACS/WFC

	-TRGB_range:	The magnitude range for what is considered "at the TRGB interface". Since
			the range of TRGB magnitudes is extremely narrow, the interface is meant 
			to capture the "environemnt" near the TRGB.

	-RGB_AGB_ratio:	The ratio of RGB to AGB stars at the TRGB interface (see TRGB_range). The
			ratio of RGB:AGB stars can be tiny (< 5%) or large (~50%). This abundance
			is not often not known a priori, and may not be known during a research
			project. The ratio of RGB:AGB used in the TRGB analysis (once artificial
			stars are generated) can always be adjusted since the RGB and AGB luminosity
			functions are modeled separately.

			Recommended: 4.0

	-min_color	The 'blue edge' of RGB at the magnitude of the TRGB.

			Recommended: >= ~1.0 

	-max_color	The red edge of RGB at the magnitude of the TRGB.

			Recommended: <= 1.5

	-color_distr:	The random distribution of colors for stars: uniform (u) or normal (n).
			This feature will appear as a 'thickness' in the color-magnitude diagrams
			of the RGB and AGB populations.

	-color_slope	The slope of the RGB (mag/color) in color-magnitude space. This translates to
			a color-dependency for stars of different magnitude. For no color-dependency,
			this value is set to a large negative number. 

			Recommended: -6

	-match_file      all.mch         # Match file used for real dataset


The shell script 'run_all' reads in the 'input_params' info and calls the Python routines to generate
the output described in (1) and (2).
